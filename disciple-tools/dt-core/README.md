# DT-Core
The D.T. core files contain most of the shared libraries, utilities, integrations, and language files. The organizational 
rule of thumb is that if it is shared beyond more than one module, it would be placed in the core to be available to all modules.

## Core Folders and Files
1. admin/ _(This folder holds all the activation, deactivation, roles, privacy, and general option files.)_
1. integrations/ _(This folder holds the integrations to analytics and facebook.)_
1. languages/ _(This folder holds traslation files.)_
1. libraries/ _(This folder holds the key Post-2-Post library which does all the work of connecting post types, and contains
a google analytics library.)_
