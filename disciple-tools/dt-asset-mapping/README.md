# Asset Mapping
Asset mapping is the process of understanding and building a directory of the "assets" that can help a new movement in an 
area. For example, a new team moving into a city would want to ask, "What churches are in this city? What Christian 
NGO's are working in this place? What believers are here?". The asset mapping module of Disciple.Tools is for this kind of 
research and organization.

## Asset Mapping Core
1. asset-mapping-post-type.php _(registers the custom post type and the fields of that post type.)_
1. asset-mapping-endpoints.php _(collection of the REST endpoints for the asset-mapping module)_
1. asset-mapping.php _(collection of functions that bridge between the endpoints and the module logic.)_
1. asset-mapping-template.php _(collection of system functions that are available to theme development)_
